Tea is the most popular of all drinks in the modern civilized society.
Nowadays, some people can go without food but they cannot go without a morning cup of tea.
It is made from the leaves of the tea plant. This plant is an evergreen shrub. It grows up to four or five feet in height.
<br>
<br>
Tea grows in plenty in China, Japan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, Ceylon, and some other countries. In Bangladesh, it is grown in Chittagong, Sylhet and Chittagong Hill Tracts.
The tea plant is grown in hilly places where there is much rainfall as well as sunshine. Tea seeds are at first sown at a place. Then the seedlings are transplanted in a specially prepared ground.
Much care is needed in watering the plants, removal of the weeds and protection of the plants from insects and worms. When the tea plants grow to a certain stage, its twigs are carefully pruned to let the new leaves grow.
Tea leaves are gathered from the plants about four times a year.
The first crop is gathered in April, the second in May, the third in June and the fourth in August.
The plants give more and more leaves up to the age of ten.
Both men and women carry the tea leaves to the mill.
They gather the leaves. After the leaves are gathered, they are dried.
They are then rolled up in machines until the color of the tea is gradually changed from brown to black.
The leaves are exposed to the air. Then it is powdered. This tea is produced for use.
<br><br>
Water is boiled and some leaves put in it. This liquor is poured through a sieve into cups. Milk and sugar are added to it. We thus get a tasteful drink.
A cup of tea gives us energy. Tea refreshes our mind and body.
<br><br>
We lose our appetite if we take too much tea. Besides, it is harmful to health if we take it in a large quantity.
Tea has a great demand in the world market. Bangladesh earns much money by exporting tea abroad. Considering the economic value of tea, we should take care of its increased production.</p>
